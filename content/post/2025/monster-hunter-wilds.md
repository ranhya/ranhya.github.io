I love Monster Hunter. It just instantly hooked me from the moment I first played rise. And it’s kept hooking me and might very well keep hooking me many more times. Playing Wilds I realized just how deep this franchise goes, I may have not played the older games (yet), but I can say for certain that from the beginning it was destined to be an amazing franchise.

Monster Hunter games are very technical. There’s a lot to learn when you get into them, and it’s what makes me say, that you can fall in love with any Monster Hunter game at least 14 times. There’s a lot to like about these games, but for me the main thing that keeps me coming back is the depth to each and every weapon in the game. It’s essentially 14 combat systems all put into one game. Every time I’ve tried a new weapon I’ve found myself enjoying the game immensely and falling in love again. Every weapon has a wildly different play style from other weapons, even the shielded weapons—and the two bowguns play differently from one another. The newer games focus a lot more on weapon enhancements compared to the older titles in the series. And Wilds has taken it to the extreme with basically every new weapon getting an upgrade of some sort—and or major changes to its play-style and move-set.

Sword and Shield became the ultimate jack of all trades, with the new perfect block mechanic along with blocking being super broken in this game—you can block attacks incredibly well even with SnS’ small shield. On top of that you get great damage and mobility with new moves added in Wilds and it’s obvious why it’s one of the most popular weapons in the game, and also my most played weapon as of the time of writing this.

There’s a lot to like about every weapon and while I still have not put the time into learning them all, I’m working on making a set for all of them—a meta set for all of the weapons that interest me. The newest weapon I’ve fallen in love with are the Dual Blades. The dual blades are probably the weapon that’s gotten the biggest upgrade in wilds, they’re now able to dish out even more damage than in previous titles such as Rise… and that’s saying something because dual blades in Rise were the best weapon in terms of pure DPS, Bow of course being right up there with them.

Hammer and Great Sword are also a lot of fun now with their new additions in Wilds, mainly the new offset mechanic which fits their play-style great and adds a lot of depth to their core gameplay. It’s fantastic. And hitting those offsets is super rewarding.
