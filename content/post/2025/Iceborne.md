Monster Hunter World: Iceborne, also known as peakborne is just as that second title implies: it’s fucking peak. This shit is peak! While, out of the Monster Hunter games I’ve played so far it’s not my #1, Wilds still takes that spot by just a little bit because it improves on peak. But Iceborne still ranks at #2 (of 3 lol, I’ll go back and play the older games too eventually ). 

I played base World like a year or two ago, and never actually finished it—since I didn’t have Iceborne at the time. Well I got Iceborne now and it’s truly peak. Finished the story and I’m now planning on moving on to the guiding lands and all the other content the endgame has to offer! Obviously with that comes crown hunting and getting all of the achievements for base World and Iceborne. Which surprisingly has a separate platinum from World which I didn’t expect. Sunbreak didn’t have a platinum so it took me a bit off guard.

I took a liking to three of the weapons in this game: Hunting Horn, Hammer and Switch Axe. Hunting Horn being my weapon of choice for most of the Iceborne story but I do plan on making builds for the other weapons too when it comes time to do that! When I started Iceborne I didn’t want to continue playing Long Sword like I did in World because I just prefer other weapons to it. And considering I played Bow in Rise and literally everything but HH and Swaxe (And Charge Blade) in Wilds, I thought it a good idea to try one of those in Iceborne!
