As GenAI and LLMs get better and better I grow more weary of my passion for writing as now it feels like by the time I’m able to really do anything AI will have already taken over and my work remain forever drowning in an ocean of AI slop articles and novels. For the longest time now ever since I’ve found myself indulging in escapism I’ve wanted to write fiction but haven’t even gotten around to it yet, wanting to be a published author one day I’ve been _meaning_ to actually read more books and try to get myself in a position where I can write something I’m proud of. I know the first thing I write probably won’t be a masterpiece but I really wish to write it the best I can.

For a while now inside me, I’ve had the sentiment that maybe it’s not worth it actually writing a book anymore if it means having my voice drowned by AI slop. But part of me is still hopeful that it is not yet a dying medium. AI has naught the creativity of humans and I really cannot conceive a world where an AI could write a better novel than a novelist. I’m actually thankful that my generation still enjoys books and writing—and finds and interest in it as I hope this medium doesn’t die out as I grow old and senile, and I’ll hopefully manage to reach people with my work someday 

I made this site so that I could write my heart out and all of that and I do think I’ve been doing a decent job of keeping the site updated even with getting injured and typing without my thumb lol.

But as I’ve been writing more and more for this site I’ve noticed a few quirks in my writing style, leftovers from when I used to properly do RP and stuff (god no more Google docs please), emdashes being the biggest one. And it peeves me that emdashes are now seen as a quirk of AI writing instead of a quirk of AO3 writing lol. It’s a bit unfortunate, while I do believe that my use of them is distinguishable from that of an LLM’s—it still peeves me and makes me reluctant to use them now.

I think in the future I’ll still use them but try not to overly rely on them as I may have been, it’s a bit silly of me to do this but—I do also feel that changes in writing style even over trivial things such as these, are an overall positive. 

At least I don’t bold every other word lol. Another stupid AI quirk.

As you can probably guess I’m anti-AI, especially GenAI… LLMs peeve me but oh boy GenAI just fucking SUCKS. I genuinely can’t wait for the bubble to burst and for it to maybe fall into obscurity but I doubt it would as it is a huge money saver for a lot of the big corporations which means it’s here to stay I think. It’s been so long yet no legislation or laws have been created and won’t be for a long time as well. All of it is just crap if you ask me—on top of that AI provides nothing of substance really. 

It doesn’t write good code, it can’t write good anything. It lies to you constantly, and the worst part is it does it so confidently that most idiots believe what it says blindly. But I also get it, as search engines have gotten so shit recently that you can’t find ANYTHING anymore without searching for hours on end and sifting through… guess what, tens and hundreds of AI generated slop articles.
