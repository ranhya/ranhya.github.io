I love Stardew Valley. I first played the game I don’t know how many years ago, and I was hooked—I was young and I had just saw a YouTube video or two about it, mainly DangerouslyFunny videos where he used mods and stuff and did massive harvests. My first introduction to the game was modded lol, I guess that speaks wonders to the kind of game it is.

I’ve been playing on my phone and I think it’s a great phone game! The mobile versions have an “emergency save” feature that lets you start right back from where you left off in the day so you don’t have to sleep to save. That means you can play for a few minutes then put the game down no problem! And I think that’s awesome.

As of the time I’m writing this I'm in fall of year one, about to enter into winter. I’m close to being done with the community center, can easily finish it in year two! I mostly fished in the early game and got my money that one + multiple harvest crops, which I love! Just plant them once and don’t worry about it for the rest of the season! I’ve got a bunch of ancient fruit which I plan on planting on spring of year two and I’m also excited to plant starfruit in summer!

The one thing I’ve been neglecting is friendship. I plan on doing that a bit later, possibly starting in year two as it’s a bit difficult for me to remember all these schedules and stuff! I’ve got a good stockpile of diamonds and other gifts so that shouldn’t be a problem!

I’ve got the mines finished off and my PB in the skull caverns is 21! I definitely will need to go way deeper but for now that’s okay.
