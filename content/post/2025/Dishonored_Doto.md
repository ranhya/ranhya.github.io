summary: Out of all the Dishonored games, I liked this one the most. I think it’s the best one, despite being a short spinoff game. It’s a sequel to Dishonored 2, where you play as Meghan Foster, AKA Billie Lurk. I think this game was made to cap off the Dishonored series so it’s no doubt that this is the last game  in the series. I think the endings, both good and bad complete the story of the series in a satisfying way.

Out of all the Dishonored games, I liked this one the most. I think it’s the best one, despite being a short spinoff game. It’s a sequel to Dishonored 2, where you play as Meghan Foster, AKA Billie Lurk. I think this game was made to cap off the Dishonored series so it’s no doubt that this is the last game  in the series. I think the endings, both good and bad complete the story of the series in a satisfying way. 

The best part about this game in my opinion, are Billie’s powers. In comparison to the previous characters’ powers, Billie’s are by far the strongest and are made to synergize with each other. Billie gets access to three powers right off the get go in mission 2. These are all the powers you have at your disposal and none more can be unlocked. The three powers are: Semblance — allows you to steal another’s face, making enemies not detect you, uses many only when you move. Displace — Allows you to place a marker by pressing L2 once, pressing L2 again will teleport you to the marker you placed. You do need direct line of sight but this ability is the strongest of all the blink abilities and synergizes really well with Billie’s third ability, Foresight — This ability allows you to, leave your body and float about, scan the area and see enemies and items through walls. Time is stopped during this and your mana is constantly draining. You can mark enemies and items and most importantly, you can place a Displace marker.

The reason Foresight works so well with Displace is that, Displace can take you past windows and other things, the only issue being that you cannot normally fit your reticle through them and jump past. With Foresight you can—for example go past a wall of light and up stairs to a grated window, put a Displace marker down next to that grated window and jump to it, bypassing the wall of light!

Foresight also extends your range quite drastically and allows you to teleport to places that would otherwise be too far away for your reticle to reach!

That’s all very cool and all but my favorite ability playing through the game was Semblance. You can do so many things with it, I mainly used it to cross areas with lots of guards. There’s a lot of special interactions when using Semblance though that I don’t wanna spoil.

In conclusion, Dishonored: Death of the Outsider is an amazing game that caps off a great series.
