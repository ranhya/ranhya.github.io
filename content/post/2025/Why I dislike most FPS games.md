Okay, the title is kind of a lie. I don’t *dislike* FPS games[^1]. I think I’m disappointed with the current state the genre is in. What do I mean by that exactly, I’m not 100% sure myself. That’s what I want to find out by writing this blog post. I’m not one with a really long history in FPS games but I’ve played them quite a lot over the years nonetheless.

I probably have around 4000 hours sunk into various games, but the biggest chunk that time is in one game: *Apex Legends*. There’s a reason I have so many hours in the game—well a few reasons:

1. I started playing it like a week after it had been released
2. It is free to play
3. I enjoy the game

I had just gotten my PS4, and I barely had any games for it considering I had no money and had already finished the one game I did own (Uncharted 4). So, I went looking in the free-to-play section of the store, as one does when they don’t have any games to play :D

Anyways I found Apex and immediately fell in love with the game, even though I *sucked so bad at it*, that’s not an understatement I was absolute dog, and I continued to be dog for years to come lol. I’m still dog, even though as of 25 August 2025, I have clocked in about *2727* hours in the game. That’s only the PS4 version and it doesn’t include time played on alt accounts either.

## What I Dislike About FPS Games

I think what I dislike about them is their fleetingness paired with, unoriginality—it feels as though every new FPS game that comes out nowadays is in one of a few categories. BR, CS/Valorant clone… or uh yeah that’s it w.

There’s some standout games here and there that don’t follow this pattern, which I’ll get into but in general most of the FPS games coming out nowadays are either tactical shooters or BRs and I think it’s sad. Arena shooters don’t really get made anymore and games like Apex are very reluctant to add non-BR modes. Though in recent times Respawn have been a lot better about this.

### THE FINALS

About those standout games though: I think the best shooter out right now is probably THE FINALS, and it’s not much of a competition lol. THE FINALS is not a *new* game, it released in 2023. But recently saw a surge in popularity due to patches and popular streamers picking it up. 

The reason I like THE FINALS so much is that, it’s unique. It’s got an original main game mode, *Cashout*, that’s actually unique and a lot of fun. The game does have classes technically, though what I like about them is you’re not locked into one specific play style—still limited based on the class you play but that’s to be expected. The gunplay is not my favorite but it is really solid and it’s just a personal preference for me, as I really dislike hitscan in shooters. I much prefer projectile weapons as that’s what I’m used to from Apex. The game does offer a few projectile weapons though! The bow, throwing knives, I think the medium grenade launcher and some heavy shotguns are projectile. Not that many to choose from but still welcome! In fact, I mostly played the bow in the game lol.

Despite all of that, I don’t play THE FINALS regularly at all. I think while the game is awesome and probably the best FPS game out there at the moment—it’s not exactly for me. The game’s main flaw is that communication is so important that playing it alone is akin to some medieval torture techniques, it’s that bad. Because of the nature of the game modes, not having a coordinated team with comms makes it INCREADIBLY hard to win especially as a beginner to the game. I don’t have anyone to play the game with and I don’t really like playing games with other people so it just isn’t for me.

## Splitgate

Splitgate one flopped. It was a great game in my opinion. It was original and wasn’t a BR or anything like that. Splitgate 2 is just Splitgate one but better, issue is that they’ve caved and added a BR mode! A super lackluster one at that! It was horrible. But I do think the game still has a glimmer of hope in my eyes as, there’s a server browser, and game modes other than the stupid BR one.

Mechanically the game is great and feels great to play, the portals are awesome and offer a lot of opportunities for outplays blah blah blah. The only issue I had with the game was the BR mode which is completely avoidable! I think that’s cool and I do hope this game succeeds.
