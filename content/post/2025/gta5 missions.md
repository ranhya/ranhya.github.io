It has been a really long time since I last played GTA 5 so I barely remember anything, but a GTA 5 video came up in my YouTube recommendations and the thought came to my mind, GTA 5’s missions fucking SUCK.

There’s not that many good missions in the game with the heists being somewhat decent, and even those don’t have much going for them. The missions of the game just feel like “drive to this place, watch cutscene, shoot people, watch cutscene, mission passed”

There’s zero substance to the missions and basically 0 player agency, it feels like if you just turn around in the wrong direction you fail the mission. The script of the missions is beyond insane with literally all of the agency taken away from the player.

As testament to how scripted the game is: it took 12 years for speedrunners to figure out how to skip the long ass train cutscene in prologue.

And besides 4, it is also the only 3D GTA game that does not have insane on mission 0 glitches.
