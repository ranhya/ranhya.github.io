I've been kinda slacking off this month, but that's okay. Here's what I've been playing this month:

- Silksong
- Watch Dogs
- Assassin’s Creed Origins

Obviously I’ve been playing Silksong, I’ve waited for this game for I don’t know how long and it for sure hasn’t disappointed. I’ve been taking notes here and there about my thoughts on the game, first impression was that the game is HARD and that still reigns true even 33 hours in, even more so now in fact. I’ll for sure write a post on it when I’ve completed the game. I’m not even in act 3 yet, I’ve just been taking my sweet time enjoying what the game has to offer!

Part of why it’s taking so long is that I’m not looking up ANYTHING, I don’t even look at anything related to Silksong, if it comes up I just click off so as to not get spoiled. Going in completely blind has been an amazing experience.

As for Watch Dogs, I’ve already played the game in the past, but I’ve recently been replaying through the missions so that I can get 100%, and finally finish off the platinum for the game. I’d realized the online trophies can’t stop me from getting it now, as I abused a free multiplayer weekend to get the one online trophy that required a PS Plus subscription. I didn’t play it all too much but I will finish it off eventually.

I’ve started playing Assassin’s Creed Origins, I’m only a few hours into the game. This is my first time playing an Assassin’s Creed game, and so far I can get behind this, especially getting to Alexandria and assassinating some random guy for a quest was super awesome and felt great. Can’t wait to see what else the game has to offer!
