Peak gaming. Cat Quest is a game I remember from when I was a little girl—and seeing it on sale for super cheap, I nabbed it. It was a great decision. I remembered this game very fondly and I’m glad to report that it is not nostalgia this game slaps.

The gameplay loop is addictive and keeps you playing, I played it for 10 hours and got the [platinum](https://youtu.be/y6QPlokR4M4), couldn’t put the game down for those 10 hours. You can watch my full playthrough split into three parts here: [Cat Quest Playthrough](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjp8D5bPtjerF7WUOLA4qm1tahEC1eKzt&si=DXrMpVgTN7bZmgzg)

## Combat

The combat system is incredibly polished and the movement, attacking and spells all feel very good. It’s very satisfying killing groups of enemies, collecting EXP and coins dropped from killed enemies makes me literally ooze dopamine from my pores it’s just that good.

The spells are very thought out, though a lot of them are outshined by 3 spells specifically. You can get every spell after beating the first main boss in the game (dragon) which is cool. Though the most useful ones so heavily outshine the other ones that I mostly ended up using 3 spells, and was melting bosses way above my own level, skull icon and all.

The game isn’t super difficult obviously, it doesn’t need to be. But it provides enough of a challenge to keep you engaged and the combat loop is super fun. Repetitive? Yes but the game is short enough that I never once got bored of just killing things. Even just grinding felt fun.

I really love the spells and I think they’re super cool because of the way they work. You have 5 damage spells available to you: fire, ice, lighting, trap and a purple magic idk what it is lol. The thing I really like about them is that they all have different patterns they hit in! Lighting hits to the sides of your character while ice hits in the front and in the back, fire is a big AOE circle and the purple magic thing hits in an X shape. The trap magic is special as it leaves a spike trap behind that lasts a few seconds and hurts the enemies that stand on it.

Other than those you have a healing spell which becomes less and less useful as you become more powerful and, the most broken ability in the game—an ability that gives you a percentage boost to your damage, all of it. At max level I think it’s like an 100% boost and it is BROKEN. It only consumes a sliver of your mana so you can spam it in every encounter and absolutely melt every enemy with lighting and fire spells (they deal the most damage)

## Story, Side-Quests and Exploration

The story serves its purpose, the dialogue is fun and there’s a lot of side quests with cool dialogue that you wouldn’t expect them to have.

There’s a lot of fun cat puns in the dialogue and a lot of the side quests have fun stories, it’s kind of unexpected from a tiny game such as this. I think there’s in total maybe over 66 side quests in the game so there’s a lot of food :D.

The exploration at first feels slow because you move really slow but it isn’t necessarily an issue as the map is quite small. I did the bulk of the exploration after beating the third dragon boss as you get the ability to move really really fast after that.

The caves are a fun challenge especially if you’re doing them under-leveled and there are a LOT of secrets in them which I find very fun! You get the 3 best items and the ones I ended up using for most of the end-game from these chests. All secret items of course.

Yup that’s about it. Play Cat Quest!!! It’s purrfect! :3
