![Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart](/images/ratchet_and_clank.jpeg)

This game is a peculiar one. I had a lot of fun with it. There’s a lot to this game even though the amount of playtime you get out of it is uh... not that much. I [platinumed](https://youtu.be/BulmHsqutWE) the game in about ~14 hours and I did mostly take my time playing through the game at a considerably slow pace. You could clock in about 20 hours max but the price makes it absolutely not worth buying. $70 dollars for a game such as this is just too much! The game itself is awesome and a lot of fun but the price is not at all justified. It’s worth like, 30-40 dollars at best. I got the game for “free” with PS Plus Extra, but if it weren’t for that I wouldn’t have played it. The game does seem to go on sale often but just strictly judging it off of base price, I wouldn’t buy it.

Ignoring the price, the game is awesome lot of fun. It’s the only game I’ve played so far that utilizes the DualShock 5’s unique features so well. Adaptive triggers and the vibration features make the game a great tactile experience. All of the guns have different trigger weights and it actually works properly unlike in almost every other game I’ve played where the actuation point of the triggers was for some reason before the heaviest part of the trigger press...

For certain weapons holding the trigger on the part of the actuation before the heaviest part makes them do different things. Like the first weapon you get in the game: the burst pistol — if you lightly tap and hold the trigger you get single shots but if you pull the trigger down all the way you get a triple shot spread pattern when the weapon is upgraded.

Apart from the gameplay, the story of Rift Apart is not too shabby actually. It’s cliche and plays out like a kids movie, but that doesn’t make it bad :D

Within the story you swap between Rivet and Ratchet as they go to different planets trying to recover the dimensionator and save the universe! The characters are all fun and like-able and the writing is decently entertaining!
