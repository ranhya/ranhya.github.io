Untitled Goose Game might be honking perfect! It’s a short game where you play as a Goose and it came out quite a while ago now—and has won multiple awards, for good reason. At first when I saw the game I thought it was cool but overtime I had sort of grown to dislike it, thinking I likely wouldn’t play it. However, having played it now, I can say that it definitely lives up to the hype and the love this game has received is most deserved.

You’re obviously a goose, and you go around this town causing mayhem while completing your “To-Do Lists.” The game has a total of 5 levels and each one is interconnected and you can always go back and forth between levels, which allows you to bring items and stuff from other levels but it’s not strictly necessary and you probably won’t be doing that unless you’re doing one of the secret tasks! The game is honestly a blast, and once you get into the rhythm of doing stuff it feels so majestically awesome. I remember I was trying to get the quickly achievement for the 3rd level and managing both the old man and the woman all while trying to tasks in the most efficient way I could find was exhilarating! 

The game is quite short, I achieved [100% completion](https://youtu.be/Jtn9aHK93b8?si=dJ3SaGOc4VHmUx-9) within about 6 hours.
