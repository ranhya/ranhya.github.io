An old game that, while very barely—still holds on to this day! There’s a lot of insanely cool things this game did for its time, the looting system is especially something that was super revolutionary in a game like this. 

I first got the game 4 years ago, but I had gotten a bunch of other games along with it on sale so I didn’t get to play it much, even more so as I’d gotten stuck in the early game at the time. So I ended up putting the game off for a long time, and finally got back to it when I got my PS5. For the longest time I thought, maybe looter shooters just aren’t for me, maybe they aren’t but Borderlands should’ve been a game I loved. I’m a sucker for RPGs and numbers games in general so there must’ve been something I was doing wrong, right?

Well cut to one day, or night, I was watching YouTube and came across a Borderlands video: [This EXTREMELY RARE Drop Just Made Gaming History!](https://youtu.be/MasrjKgjTzg). It’s a great video and you should watch it, but in the video Joltzdude139 talks a bit about how the loot system in Borderlands 1 works, and it was what got me sold on the game... after I’d bought it.

So I start playing again, and I get hooked, line and sinker or whatever. From the game’s (poorly aged but still funny-ish) dialogue and humor to the honestly decently challenging combat and even the janky-ness of it all had a certain appeal to it. Skip forward about 41 hours later and I’m finally done with the base game trophies and popped the [plat](https://youtu.be/YzRNzvsMsTo?si=BUJDaW8bUMIQk29n)
