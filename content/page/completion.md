[^1]: 100% Doesn't necessarily mean 100% of the in-game completion (if the game has a counter, or something similar) but rather what I deem to be 100%. e.g. I consider getting all of the confidants in Persona 5 to max to be 100%. Even though the game has a lot of in-game achievements with the new thieves' den area introduced in Royal.
