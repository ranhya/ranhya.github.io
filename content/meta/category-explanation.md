**<dt>Blog</dt>**
<dd>This is where the main blog posts sit—all of them related to gaming in one way or another.</dd>

**<dt>Meta</dt>**
<dd>For meta posts, aka posts about the site itself and or about me. Just a general category for stuff that I deem fit for it lol.</dd>

**<dt>Offtopic</dt>**
<dd>I’m not sure about this category name yet. Anyways it’s just anything not related to gaming. Be it anime, TV shows or anything else I decide to write about, it will be here most likely.</dd>
