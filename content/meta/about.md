This is a site that I don’t expect many people to read, it’s mostly just for me to keep track of what video games I’ve played and my thoughts on them—just in a public manner because why not. I’ll try to keep it updated as much as possible because I don’t want to be another person with a “blog” that only has like two posts lol.

If you like the site you can message me on discord @ranhya and tell me what you think about it! I’m not really on any other social media so.
