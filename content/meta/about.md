My name is Rei, I’m a normal girl that likes to play video games and write about it. I don’t expect most people to read this site. I made this site just as a place to post my writing, be it about video games, some of my other hobbies and just my general thoughts about a topic or something like that. At first this site was mainly meant to be a collection of my thoughts on video games I’ve completed however I decided that I shouldn’t limit myself to that since I have a lot of fun writing.

I have a few other interests besides video games and you may or may not see me write about them here but I will list them nevertheless.

- Conlanging
- Phonology 
- Linguistics in general
- Japanese Drama and other types of TV shows (western or otherwise)
- Anime
- Achievement Hunting

You should also check out [This Post](/meta/completion), which is a list of every game I’ve completed—with relevant links to either posts I’ve written about them or links to YouTube videos of me achieving said completion. 
> P.S. if you need to contact me for whatever reason (I don’t know why you would), you can email me at `nasurei22@gmail.com`
