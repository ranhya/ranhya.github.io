This is a list of the games I have completed—not in any particular order. The games in "platinumed" are games I have gotten all the achievements for but have not done enough for me to consider them completed 100%.[^1]
## 100%
- [Sekiro: Shadow Die Twice](/posts/sekiro/) - 85 Hours
- [Hades](/posts/hades/) - 10th platinum - ~100 hours
- Ratchet and Clank - ~30 hours
- Risk of Rain 2 - ~150 hours
- Hollow Knight - ~100 hours
- NieR: Automata - ~45 hours
- [Bloodborne](/posts/bloodborne/) (No DLC) - 150 hours

[^1]: 100% Doesn't necessarily mean 100% of the in-game completion (if the game has a counter, or something similar) but rather what I deem to be 100%. e.g. I consider getting all of the confidants in Persona 5 to max to be 100%. Even though the game has a lot of in-game achievements with the new thieves' den area introduced in Royal.
