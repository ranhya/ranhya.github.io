## It's just awesome
Sifu is one of the best games I’ve ever played. It’s just genius, the way everything is put together it feels like a game made with so much love and passion. It’s a game with infinite replay-ability—and you’re constantly getting better as you play, the better you get the more fun it becomes. Your first play-through you’re barely figuring out the enemies patterns and struggling to finish the levels without dying—you learn the level and then finally get to the boss at a reasonable age only to die like 10 times just to beat him… but you go on—and by the end you’ve gotten pretty decent, the levels are hard but you can get through them without dying, and you feel confident that you can beat the last boss… I think on my first play-through I got to the last boss at like age 60, and it took a bunch of tries and finally learning how to parry in order to beat him.

The satisfaction I felt was immense. And every other boss became a pushover (kinda… Kuroki still kicks my ass lol).

The game’s combat is so incredibly satisfying, and makes you feel like a total badass kungfoo master. It’s really fun stringing together combos and destroying entire groups of enemies in seconds when you get good. And all of the abilities you unlock are incredibly cool and allow for so many play-styles. The game felt completely different at the end when I had all the abilities unlocked, it’s truly freeing.

## The Arenas
The Arenas mode that was added later on via a free update is where you might spend most of your time after beating the game. It takes the arcade style of the game and turns it up to the max... and it's also really fucking hard, not even master difficulty is as hard as some of these challanges. The gameplay is also varied with different modes—like a TA mode, control mode... mode where you kill all the targets etc. they really spice things up.

Not only that but there are a lot of new environments and maps to play around in! It's super awesome that all of this came for free with an update! The amount of content here is awesome, especially since you get it all for free!
