*Truly one of the games of all time.*


For real this game isn’t really the best. It’s not a bad game by any means it was fun enough to play and to [platimum](https://youtu.be/wegKy2scNXM) but it was short and kept missing on like so many aspects. I played the other Spider-Man game a while back and it was MILES (haha get it?) better than this. At least from what I remember, it’s been a really long time.

## The Story

The story  SUCKS. **spoilers ahead because I want to talk about this**

The story isn’t just mid it is bad. I didn’t… I mean I couldn’t care about any of the characters, the dialogue was super mid and Phin especially I think is just a bad character with zero substance. Every character is shallow but she especially is super shallow and annoying.

The main reason she does anything is because her brother died or something but she has no reason to be mad since it’s all his fault anyways for developing Nuform, and making himself sick, he should’ve taken precautions even if Simon wasn’t taking them. It wasn’t even explained how he got sick or how Nuform makes people sick so it’s just odd. Her reasoning is not sound at all and all she does is get mad at Miles for no fucking reason dude it’s insane. And not only that but then she stops listening to him completely and then almost destroys all the city—only to then fucking die in the end thank God.

Insane stuff. The plot is shallow and the characters are one-dimensional without any sort of development or anything—in fact Phin gets 0 development she’s exactly the same at the end as she was at the start.

The dialogue is corny and makes me cringe constantly—there’s nothing good about it. And the constant messaging of family this and that loved ones are the most important it whatever is so overdone and so corny I couldn’t stand listening to it.

The only character I thought was kind of cool was the deaf girl.

Oh yeah and you can’t skip most of the cutscenes in this game, it sucks.

## The Gameplay

The gameplay is not bad, it’s pretty fun and satisfying for the most part. It’s not great either though, it misses on a lot of aspects specifically the combat—while it is fun it is super tedious on higher difficulties as the enemies become health sponges and you have to kill like 50 enemies in every encounter so it gets tedious really quickly.

Friendly is the best difficulty in my opinion as the enemies aren’t health sponges but you can still die in it at least. Anything above friendly increases your playtime by 209392495 hours because the enemies take SO long to die.

### Movement outside of combat

The movement outside of combat such as swinging and stuff feels WAY worse than the 2018 Spider-Man game. Part of that is due to the fact that in this game Miles doesn’t swing from a real point in the world but rather he swings from air, which you’d think would make it better but it in fact makes it worse. It’s worse because you never really know what or where you’re swinging from so it feels a bit random and weird. Not to say that it’s bad—it works perfectly fine but it is definitely WAY worse than in the other game.

It also ruins photo-mode because you get random ass webs in the middle of nowhere and it just ruins the pictures which is a real bummer lol. They could’ve at least tried to do it better 

### Collectibles

I had more fun doing these than anything else in the game. I chose to include the bases and stuff in this category as well as they are basically collectibles.

There’s a lot of them in the game but they’re super quick to get for the most part. Thought the game tricks you into thinking you got them all only to slap you with a new type of collectible as you progress to the story and even after completing whole story. Though it’s not bad as I did quite enjoy getting these, as you get to swing around and use the movement in the game which is fun.

### Side-Quests

The side-quests are okay. They’re not the greatest and there aren’t really enough but they’re good for what they are and I honestly looked forward more to doing them than doing the main missions lol.

Yup that’s all. Oh yeah the cat costume is cool though!

## Platinum Experience 

I like when you have to 100% games for the platinum. And I found getting the platinum for this game a lot of fun just because you have to do everything so it was nice. What I didn’t like was the fact that you have to replay the game in NG+

The game doesn’t have any difficulty trophies—which is nice. I do really like difficulty trophies so it’s also kind of a bummer but at the same time the hardest difficulties suck ass in this game as it’s less about challenge and more that they’re a time sink.

There’s also some nice trophies like the paying respects ones—I like these types of miscellaneous trophies!
