I’ll be detailing a few tips on getting all of your confidants to MAX in Persona 5 Royal. This can be done on your first playthrough with ease if you just keep a few things in mind. This is a lot more lenient than in the original Persona 5.

- Always carry a persona of the same arcana as the confidant you’re about to hang out with, this increases the amount of points you get.
- On that note you should always pick the best dialogue option for the most points. You can easily Google these or once you have it you can use Chihaya’s last ability to tell you which ones to choose. Obviously googling is better as you don’t have to spend 10k yen for it.
- Prioritize hanging out with confidants over everything else
- Books are amazing, ideally you read them after reading the speed reading book you can get from the school library on and after July 1st. But you can probably do it before if you have time, especially on the days you get to read on the train. So you will ideally always have an unread book available for those days.
- Big Bang Burger Challenge is really good for stats, just make sure you can pass it before trying. It will give you points in every stat every time you pass it.
- USE CHIHAYA!!! When you unlock her you should get her up ASAP as she has super duper useful abilities. Some confidants will have events where you cannot get enough points in order to advance them the next time you hang out, so it will waste time. However with Chihaya you can avoid this completely by using her abilities, specifically her rank 5 one which will increase your affinity with a confidant of your choice, doing this does not advance time and you can use it to avoid having to do extra hangouts with confidants and waste days. Her other abilities are very useful too.
